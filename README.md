## Development Environment

In this course, we will use either CodeLite or Visual Studio (Not Visual Studio Code). 

- CodeLite Setup: [[1, Section 2]](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/learn/lecture/18801420#overview)

- Visual Studio  Setup: [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/qeH9Xv_90KM)

Note that don't overstress yourself with the pressure of the development environment setup. Even if it's not successfully setup, you can still program using online compilers like:

- [Repl Online C++ Compiler](https://repl.it/languages/cpp) (Code can be saved once you register for a free account, **recommended**)
- [Programiz Online C++ Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/) (Code cannot be saved)
